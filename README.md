Project created to model the motion of a charged muon through a scintillating array. The quantum efficiency of the array, the stopping probability of the muon, and the muon lifetime are all tunable parameters of the problem. The program then generates plots to show the 
passage of the muon through the array, as well as the "pulse" output for an observer checking the output signal from the array.
